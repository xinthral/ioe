## Supported Versions

Currently the project is in preAlpha development, meaning that the idea has not been fully flushed out. Features are still being considered and thrown at the project table. This means that there is no "Supported" version yet, however once it gets to a production-ready state, certain versions will be maintained as supported and stable. An example of that may look like:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 0.2.0 | :x:                |
|   0.2.0 | :white_check_mark: |
|   0.2.x | :new_moon:         |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities are a natural process in development, they are the piece of the puzzle that is often overlooked or allowed to linger for far too long. The best guard against the chaos is a strong community of like-minded individuals who want to see the success of the project. Should you find a vulnerability or an inconsistency that could lead to one; please send all correspondence to xinthral@yahoo.com or on the discussion board once the project gets closer to production.

Not all vulnerabilities are project breaking, and some vulnerabilities are only problematic conditionally. However they all need to reported, investigated, and a decision made on how to proceed.
