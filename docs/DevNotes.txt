  world into the world of <terfeldier>. However, in the process of traversing the void between realms these 
  ritual cede were touched by with the flux.
  ```

* Corporation that's running thing is the bad-guy
  ```

  instead of across the realm, pulling outworlders in mass. The sacrifice is for some ancient evil, that's resides deep
  beneath <Death Mountain>
  ```

* Resistance factions fighting against Corporation
  ```
  * Inherently, survival becomes the game because you are the target of the sacrifice. And because you were touched by flux,
  the powers you begin to exibit can be put to use against those who have wronged you. You are now part of a group of people
  known as the Astral Nomad; and unbenounced to the player they are what's called "Touched" due to the flux now inside you.

  * The Syndicated is a faction that arises from those who were Touched, but when they arrived began to hear the call of the
  evil lurking below; choosing to join the sacrificial cause.
