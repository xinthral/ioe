## IoE 
Isles of Eris
This game engine is nothing more than a passion project for me. Intentions may be one
day to compile this into a game. Until then, the grind for a feature rich, highly 
modulated, but easily customizable game engine is more than an over-reach however I am
undeterred. Taking my lumps along the way, we press on....more to come.
