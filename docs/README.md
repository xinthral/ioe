# IoE 
Isles of Eris
This game engine is nothing more than a passion project for me. Intentions may be one day to compile this into a game. Until then, the grind for a feature rich, highly modulated, but easily customizable game engine is more than an over-reach however I am undeterred. Taking my lumps along the way, we press on....more to come.


#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash

```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```bash

```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```bash

```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
