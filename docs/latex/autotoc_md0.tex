Isles of Eris This game engine is nothing more than a passion project for me. Intentions may be one day to compile this into a game. Until then, the grind for a feature rich, highly modulated, but easily customizable game engine is more than an over-\/reach however I am undeterred. Taking my lumps along the way, we press on....more to come.

Using Doxygen document generation, you can make a library of web browsable documents detailing the entirety of the project.

\#\#\#\# Documentation in H\+T\+ML format\+:

\#\#\#\# Core Engine, vrooom\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}

This project was bootstrapped with \href{https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app}{\tt Create React App}.

In the project directory, you can run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm start
\end{DoxyCode}


Runs the app in the development mode.\textbackslash{} Open \href{http://localhost:3000}{\tt http\+://localhost\+:3000} to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\textbackslash{} You may also see any lint errors in the console.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm test
\end{DoxyCode}


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\textbackslash{} See the section about \href{https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests}{\tt running tests} for more information.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm run build
\end{DoxyCode}


Builds the app for production to the {\ttfamily build} folder.\textbackslash{} It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\textbackslash{} Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about \href{https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment}{\tt deployment} for more information.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm run eject
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Note\+: this is a one-\/way operation. Once you {\ttfamily eject}, you can\textquotesingle{}t go back!}

If you aren\textquotesingle{}t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can {\ttfamily eject} at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, E\+S\+Lint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except {\ttfamily eject} will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\textquotesingle{}re on your own.

You don\textquotesingle{}t have to ever use {\ttfamily eject}. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\textquotesingle{}t be useful if you couldn\textquotesingle{}t customize it when you are ready for it.
