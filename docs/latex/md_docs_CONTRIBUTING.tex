\item Enable the checkbox to \href{https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork}{\texttt{ allow maintainer edits}} so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
\item We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using \href{https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request}{\texttt{ suggested changes}} or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
\item As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as \href{https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request\#resolving-conversations}{\texttt{ resolved}}.
\item If you run into any merge issues, checkout this \href{https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts}{\texttt{ git tutorial}} to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

This engine can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Regular Expressions\+: Windows uses {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n} for line endings, while Unix-\/based systems use {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n}. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r?\textbackslash{}n} instead of {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n} in order to support both environments.
\item Paths\+: Windows systems use {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} for the path separator, which would be returned by \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path}{\texttt{ path}} are needed for constructing URLs -\/ or calling files by relative path.
\item Bash\+: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, which is why I recommend installing \href{https://chocolatey.org}{\texttt{ Chocolatey}} and following instructions in the \mbox{\hyperlink{md_docs_README}{README}} to establish \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg-docs/blob/main/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vscode.md}{\texttt{ vscpkg}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysection{Linux}\label{md_docs_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md26}
The engine was primarliy developed on Linux, however there are a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Same as before, newline and linefeed characters are different so get an IDE that shows these characters and turn that feature on. Also, the \href{https://man.archlinux.org/man/dos2unix.1.en}{\texttt{ dos2unix}} tool can be a fantastic catch-\/all to find and remove these hidden symbols if the compilation gives any weird errors this is worth a try.
\item Compilation is performed with C++20, aka \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html\#cxx20}{\texttt{ gnu++2a}}. You may be able to get away with C++17, but some features may not work well if compiled with anything older.
\item Posix is a superior protocol.
